# Autonomous_Car
This repository contains the codes of three functionalities of our Autonomous car which can be controlled by hand gesture using accelerometer, detect obstacles, and can also be controlled by Wi-Fi using NodeMCU operated by Blynk App. These C++ codes were coded and fed to NodeMCU, ArduinoUNO, and ArduinoNano respectively through Arduino IDE.
